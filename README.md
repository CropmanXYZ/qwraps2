# qwraps2
A collection of helpful functions for summarizing data and formating results.
These functions are almost certainly found in other R packages on github.com, or
on CRAN.  This is a collection of methods I have generated to help with
particular projects I have worked on over the last several years.  Using my
origiinal `qwraps` package as the foundation, this work is aimed at simplicity
and ease of use.
