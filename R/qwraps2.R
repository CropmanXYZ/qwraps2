#' A collection of wrapper functions for aiding the authoring of reproducible
#' reports.
#'
#' \pkg{qwraps2} is a collection of functions I have found very useful when
#' working on a varied collection of different analysis reports.  These
#' functions are commonly used wrappers which I have been reusing and modifying
#' over several years.
#'
#' Several wrappers for \pkg{ggplot2} style graphics, such as ROC, AUC, and KM
#' plots are provided.  Named as \code{\link{qroc}}, \code{\link{qauc}}, and
#' \code{\link{qkmplot}} to pay homage to \code{qplot} form \pkg{ggplot2} and
#' the standard names for such plots.
#'
#' Other functions are used to quickly generate meaningful character strings for
#' outputting results in .Rnw, .Rmd, or other similar functions.
